# Examples on using bunnyto build and package unikernels

The current directory provides various examples for packaging existing unikernel
images as OCI images for [urunc](https://github.com/nubificus/urunc). It can
also serve as a boilerplate for the transition from
[pun](https://github.com/nubificus/pun) and
[bima](https://github.com/nubificus/bima) to `bunny`.
